There is no functional purpose to this project.  I haven't programmed any significant projects in Java for several years, so this is just some extra practice to re-familiarize myself with Java and learn some of its newer features.  What better way to do that than by building some data structures and solving some interesting projects I come across?

Problems that I answer here have been found all over the place.  I do use some online programming sites, but I tend to answer those problems in the web platform instead of here.  So this project is not exhaustive of all I have done to re-familiarize myself with Java nor is it necessarily the only practice I have done.
